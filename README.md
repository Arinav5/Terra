# Terra
Terra is an application that reminds users to water their plants. 
Note: Because this project contains an sql database you'll likely be unable to run it. 
How it works: The user creates an account where they record all their plants and set the number of days the plants should be watered after. The program then reminds the users to water their plants through emails. There are also other features like plant recommendations. 

-----In the future I plan to further develop this project by possibly making it a web based application.
